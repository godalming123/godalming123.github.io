You know the drill windows releases an update on your computer in middle of working and now you've only got a measly gig of ram left cause the microsoft dev's have 32gb and just don't care! So yuor gonna to buy that shiny new m1 mac **STOP** before you ditch that perfectly good computer you can upgrade it!

#### The first thing you have to do is check your computer supports adding ram
1. press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>DELETE</kbd>
2. Select task manager just above the cancel button.
3. Click perfermanc tab in task manager
4. click ram
5. under slots you should see 1/2 or 1/2 if the former number is lower then the later so far all good.
6. Finally you need to check your prosescor supports to the ram if so **your good to go!**

#### The next step is to choose your ram
The best way to get your ram correct is to open your laptop/desktop.
##### 1. Open your laptop
###### - Remove static
The most important thing is to remove static from your laptop/desktop so you do not fry the components. To do this unplug the power and hold the power button for 5 seconds what this does is makes the prosescer gobble up any remining energy in the computer.

**On a desktop? Your done!**

**On a laptop? You need to open it and remove the battery, to do this open the laptop and unplug the battery connecter. Se below to do that.**

###### - Open the laptop
