Wondering why this site is dark? Well its becuase I am forking the
<a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/">Jekyll Themes</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman">Cayman</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal">Minimal</a>
from github pages to add dark mode! These forks add an automatic dark theme that can be changed in the **config.yaml** by setting
```
color-scheme: auto | auto-deafult-dark | dark | light
```
.

> What do the first 2 options do?
  
You ask, well the auto one will change the theme based on system theme and the other one does the same but if the browser doesnt support getting the system-theme it will deafualt to dark.

## Updates
- ### I added support for changing the theme in the config.yaml
  I have just merged a branch that adds support for changing the theme in the config.yaml options just say:
  ```
  color-scheme: dark | light | auto | auto-deafualt dark
  ```
  .
  The first 2 are prepty self explanatory but where it gets interesting is the last 2 as they change the theme based on the device theme the deferencew between theme lies in what they do if the device does not support changing the theme based on the device the former of the to will default to alight however the later deafualts to a dark theme.
