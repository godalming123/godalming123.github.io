I've been thinking of making blog content for a long time and now I'm doing it! I would love to just have a place where I could put my thoughts on coding and projects I'm making. There will be a home page with stuff I'm working on and and **upcoming** dialy updates so if you click on the link at the bottom of an I'm working on item you can see more about it and updates on the project.

## Updates

- ### You can now click on a blog card and see more info about the blog.
- ### There are now updates that can be added down here. 
- ### The home page is now sorted into groups **EG:** blogs, tuturiols and stuff I'm devoloping
- ### When you go to a new page there is now an animation but it only works the first time you change page I dont think this bug is my fualt see [here](https://github.com/godalming123/godalming123.github.io/issues/3)
- ### The profile picture now shrinks when you are on mobile so the top section does not take up loads of space.
- ### there are now buttons to sort my content and find the content you are looking for (they dont work yet).
- ### We added google anylytics but its not like other google anylitics it automatically diables if do not track optgion is turned on in browser. And it tells you if it has disabled itself.
