Wondering why this site is dark? Well its becuase I am forking the [jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) and [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) from github pages to add dark mode! These forks add an automatic dark theme that can be changed in the **config.yaml** by changing the ```color-scheme``` property to ```auto | auto-deafult-dark | dark | light```.

You ask, well the auto one will change the theme based on system theme and the other one does the same but if the browser doesnt support getting the system-theme it will deafualt to dark.
