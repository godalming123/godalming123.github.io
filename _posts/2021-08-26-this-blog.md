I've been thinking of making blog content for a long time and now I'm doing it! I would love to just have a place where I could put my thoughts on coding and projects I'm making. There will be a home page with stuff I'm working on and and **upcoming** dialy updates so if you click on the link at the bottom of an I'm working on item you can see more about it and updates on the project.

## Updates

- ### You can now click on a blog card and see more info about the blog.
- ### There are now updates that can be added down here.
