I'm a web devoloper designer and coder. Hoping to get A job in [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site devolopment in fact this whole site is built with jekyll! I have helped devolop the dark theme poworing this site (the theme only applies if your device is in dark mode) it is a fork of [minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) which is a theme for jekyll and github pages the platform this site is hosted on. I have also devoloped a fork of the [cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) that adds dark mode support.
