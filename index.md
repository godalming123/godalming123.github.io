# Hello!

## What I'm Working On
- ### The Dark Side
  Wondering why this site is dark? Well its becuase 
  I am forking the themes [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) and [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) to add dark mode! (these are both themes from github pages for [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). These forks add an automatic dark theme that can be changed in the **config.yaml** by changing the `color-scheme` property to `auto | auto-deafult-dark | dark | light`.
  > What do the first 2 options do?
  
  You ask, well the auto one will change the theme based on system theme and the other one does the same but if the browser doesnt support getting the system-theme it will deafualt to dark.
- ### This blog!
  I've been thinking of making blog content for a long and now I'm doing! I would love to just have a place where I could put my thoughts on coding and projects I'm making. There will be a home page with stuff I'm working on and and **upcoming** dialy updates for so if you click on the link at the bottom of an I'm working on item you can see more about it and updates on the project.
