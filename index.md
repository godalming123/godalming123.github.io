I'm a web devoloper designer and coder. Hoping to get A job in [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site devolopment in fact this whole site is built with jekyll and github pages! I have also forked the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) (a theme for jekyll and github pages) to add system based dark mode throughout this site and added the same thing for [cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
